# Movie Recommender
 Goal of this project is to recommend new movies to users. Come take a walk through how I predicted ratings on each movie for every user.

## Data
We have a couple different files in the data folder.
The first one, users.dat, contains information about users that rated movies. It has a user id, their gender, age, occupation, and zipcode.
The next file is the movies.dat file. This file contains information on all the movies in the data. This file has the movie id, the movie name with the year on the end of the title, and the genres of the movie. Some movies have one genre and some have 2 or 3 genres seperated by '|' character.
There is also the training.csv file. In this file there is data on what rating a user gave to movies.
There is a column that has the user id and then a column that has the movie id. Then it shows there rating and a time that the user rated the movie in unix time.
